Data Flow & State Management
Data Pipeline
Upload ‚Üí User uploads experience data and high-cost claimant CSV files
Validate ‚Üí System validates file format, headers, data types
Configure ‚Üí User sets up fee structures (PMPM/PEPM/flat)
Calculate ‚Üí System calculates loss ratios, PMPM metrics
Display ‚Üí Results shown in Summary Table
Analyze ‚Üí Interactive analytics dashboard with charts
Export ‚Üí Generate PDF reports for stakeholders
State Considerations
Uploaded file data should persist across pages
Fee configurations should be saveable/retrievable
Calculations should update in real-time when fees change
Error states should be handled gracefully at each step
API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
POST /api/upload - Upload CSV files GET /api/upload?template - Download templates POST /api/fees/configure - Save fee configuration GET /api/fees - Get current fee config POST /api/calculate - Calculate loss ratios & metrics GET /api/summary - Get summary table data GET /api/analytics - Get analytics data POST /api/export - Generate PDF report
Security & Compliance
HIPAA Considerations
All data handling must be HIPAA-conscious
No PHI (Protected Health Information) in logs
Encryption for data at rest and in transit
Audit logging for data access
Secure file upload/download
Data Validation
CSV headers must match templates exactly
Numeric fields must contain valid numbers
Date fields must be YYYY-MM format
File size limit: 50MB per file
Maximum 5 files total per upload
Testing Checklist
Before marking any work as complete, verify:

[ ] Page loads without errors
[ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
[ ] Navigation bar appears and works
[ ] Footer appears correctly
[ ] All links navigate properly
[ ] Responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
[ ] Loading states show during async operations
[ ] Error states display user-friendly messages
[ ] Forms validate input properly
[ ] Data persists correctly across page navigation
Deployment
Platform: Render.com
Build Command: npm run build (or appropriate for your setup)
Auto-deploy: Connected to main branch
Environment: Node.js
Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Don't break what's working - The homepage and upload page work perfectly. Don't modify shared components without testing all pages.

Always check imports - Missing imports are the #1 cause of page crashes.

Handle async properly - Always use try-catch with async/await, handle loading states.

Test navigation - Every link should work, no dead ends.

Consistent styling - Use existing Tailwind classes and component patterns.

Data dependencies - Some pages require uploaded data to function. Handle empty states gracefully.

Priority Order for Development
Fix broken pages (fees, summary, analytics) - CRITICAL
Implement fee configuration - HIGH
Build summary table with calculations - HIGH
Create analytics dashboard with charts - HIGH
Add export functionality - MEDIUM
Enhance upload validation - MEDIUM
Add user authentication - FUTURE
Implement data persistence (database) - FUTURE
Questions? Issues?
When encountering errors:

Check browser console for exact error message
Compare with working pages (homepage, upload)
Verify all imports are correct
Check for undefined variables or null access
Ensure async operations have proper error handling
Maintenance Notes
Keep dependencies updated regularly
Run security audits (npm audit)
Test thoroughly before each deployment
Document any architectural decisions
Keep this CLAUDE.md file updated with new findings

### Key Formulas Implemented (Matching Your Spreadsheet):

**Item #3:** Total Hospital Claims = Domestic (#1) + Non-Domestic (#2)

**Item #5:** Total All Medical = Hospital (#3) + Non-Hospital (#4)

**Item #7:** Total Adjusted Medical = All Medical (#5) + UC Adjustment (#6)

- Tiered: `(Singles √ó $35) + (Families √ó $65)`
- Composite: `Total √ó $47`

**Item #12-14:** Admin Fees
- PEPM fees: `Amount √ó EE Count (#17)`
- PMPM fees: `Amount √ó Member Count (#18)`
- Flat fees: `Amount`
- Total = Sum of all fees

**Item #15:** MONTHLY CLAIMS AND EXPENSES
```
= Total Adjusted Medical (#7)
+ Rx Claims (#8)
+ Rx Rebates (#9)
+ Stop Loss Fees (#10)
- Stop Loss Reimbursement (#11)
+ Total Admin Fees (#14)
```

**Item #16:** CUMULATIVE = Running total of #15

**Item #20:** PEPM Cumulative = Cumulative C&E (#16) / EE Count (#17)

**Item #25:** Monthly Difference = Actual - Budget

**Item #26:** % Difference Monthly = (Difference / Budget) √ó 100

**Item #27:** Cumulative Difference = Cumulative Actual - Cumulative Budget

**Item #28:** % Difference Cumulative = (Cumulative Diff / Cumulative Budget) √ó 100
