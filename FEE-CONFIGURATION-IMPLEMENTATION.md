## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Fee Form (FeeModal)**

#### Supported Fee Types:
- ✅ **PMPM** (Per Member Per Month)
- ✅ **PEPM** (Per Employee Per Month)
- ✅ **Flat Fee** (Fixed monthly amount)
- ✅ **% of Premium** (Percentage-based on premiums)
- ✅ **% of Claims** (Percentage-based on claims)
- ✅ **Per Transaction** (Amount × transaction count)
- ✅ **Blended Rate** (Combination of multiple components)
- ✅ **Composite Rate** (Different rates for members vs dependents)
- ✅ **Manual** (Manually entered amount)

#### Form Behavior:
- Form fields **dynamically change** based on selected fee type
- For PMPM/PEPM: Shows rate input + tiering toggle
- For %: Shows percentage input (0-100%)
- For Blended: Shows component builder (add/remove components)
- For Composite: Shows member rate + dependent rate
- Real-time calculation preview using sample enrollment data

#### Tiering Integration:
- When "Enable Tiered Pricing" is selected, embeds the **TierBuilder** component
- Visual tier configuration with min/max enrollment ranges
- Rate per tier
- Sample cost preview for 1,000 members
- Validation for gaps, overlaps, and invalid ranges

### 2. **Intelligent Calculations (useFeeCalculations hook)**

#### Auto-Calculation:
- Monitors `feeStructures` and `experienceData` for changes
- Automatically triggers recalculation when data updates
- Uses V2 fee calculator engine (`lib/calculations/fee-calculator.ts`)
- Processes all active fee structures against all enrollment months

#### Calculation Flow:

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Upload → Calculate → Display

```
1. User uploads CSV (experience data)
   ↓
2. Enrollment extracted and stored in context
   ↓
3. User creates fee structures via FeeModal
   ↓
4. useFeeCalculations hook detects new data
   ↓
5. For each month in experience data:
   - For each active fee structure:
     - Check effective date range
     - Prepare calculation request (enrollment, premium, claims)
     - Call calculateMonthlyFee()
     - Store MonthlyFeeInstance with breakdown
   ↓
6. Aggregate results:

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Recommended):
- [ ] `useFeeCalculations` hook with mock data
- [ ] FeeModal form validation
- [ ] Fee calculator for all 9 types
- [ ] Tier selection logic
- [ ] Enrollment source mapping

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Upload CSV → Fee calculation
- [ ] Add fee → Auto-calculate months
- [ ] Edit fee → Recalculate affected months
- [ ] Delete fee → Remove from calculations
- [ ] Switch enrollment source → Recalculate

### Manual Testing:
1. **Upload experience data** with 12 months of enrollment
2. **Create PMPM fee** ($500/member)
   - Verify calculation: enrollment × $500
3. **Create Tiered fee** (0-1000: $500, 1001+: $450)
   - Verify correct tier applied
4. **Create Blended fee** ($10,000 flat + 2% of premium)
   - Verify both components sum correctly
5. **Create Composite fee** (Members $450, Dependents $225)
   - Verify split calculation
6. **Edit existing fee** and verify recalculation
7. **Delete fee** and verify removal from grid
8. **Duplicate fee** and verify new instance created

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor:
- **Blended components**: Cannot reorder (delete + re-add workaround)
- **Tier validation**: Only validates on save (not real-time)
- **Enrollment source**: Currently uses placeholder calculations for non-enrollment sources

### To Fix:
- [ ] Add drag-to-reorder for blended components
- [ ] Real-time tier validation
- [ ] Map actual CSV columns to enrollment sources

### New (Required for V2):
- None! All V2 features use existing dependencies

### Types:
- `types/fees.ts` - V2 fee type system (already created)
- `types/healthcare.ts` - Experience data types (existing)

---

- [x] Support all 9 fee types
- [x] Dynamic form that adapts to fee type
- [x] Enrollment data integration
- [x] Auto-calculation on data changes
- [x] Three-panel grid layout
- [x] Calculation tooltips with breakdowns
- [x] Full CRUD operations

## 📞 Support & Documentation

### Files to Reference:
- **Type System**: `types/fees.ts`
- **Calculator Engine**: `lib/calculations/fee-calculator.ts`
- **V2 Architecture**: `FEE-CONFIGURATION-V2.md`
- **This Guide**: `FEE-CONFIGURATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Common Questions:

**Q: How do I add a new fee type?**
A: Add to `RateBasis` type in `types/fees.ts`, then update:
- `FeeModal.tsx` (add form fields)
- `fee-calculator.ts` (add calculation logic)
- `CalculationBreakdown.tsx` (add formula display)

**Q: How do I change enrollment source?**
A: Use the **EnrollmentSourceSelector** in Settings tab. (Note: Full implementation requires CSV column mapping)

**Q: Where is data stored?**
A: Client-side in `localStorage` via `HealthcareContext`. No database required for prototype.

**Q: Can I use V1 and V2 together?**
A: Yes! Use `page_enhanced.tsx` which has a toggle button to switch between V1 and V2.
