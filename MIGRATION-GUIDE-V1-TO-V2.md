# Migration Guide: V1 → V2 Fee System

## Overview

This guide helps you migrate from the legacy V1 fee system to the new V2 system with minimal disruption.

---

## 🎯 Migration Strategy

### Option A: Side-by-Side (Recommended)

Run both systems simultaneously with a toggle button.

**Pros:**
- Zero downtime
- Users can switch back if needed
- Gradual transition
- Easy rollback

**Steps:**
1. Use `page_enhanced.tsx` (already created)
2. Rename to `page.tsx`:
   ```bash
   mv app/dashboard/fees/page.tsx app/dashboard/fees/page_v1_backup.tsx
   mv app/dashboard/fees/page_enhanced.tsx app/dashboard/fees/page.tsx
   ```
3. Users see toggle button (V1/V2)
4. Default to V2 for new users, V1 for existing
5. Monitor usage, deprecate V1 after 30 days

### Option B: Direct Switch

Replace V1 completely with V2.

**Pros:**
- Clean, simple
- No confusion
- Forces adoption

**Cons:**
- No fallback
- Users must learn new system immediately

**Steps:**
1. Use `page_v2.tsx` (pure V2)
2. Rename to `page.tsx`:
   ```bash
   mv app/dashboard/fees/page.tsx app/dashboard/fees/page_v1_backup.tsx
   mv app/dashboard/fees/page_v2.tsx app/dashboard/fees/page.tsx
   ```
3. Communicate changes to users
4. Provide training

## 🔄 Data Migration

### Automatic Migration (Planned for Phase 2)

Currently, V1 and V2 data are separate in context:
- V1: `feeStructures` (old)
- V2: `feeStructuresV2` (new)

**Future feature**: "Migrate to V2" button that converts:

```typescript
// V1 Structure
{
  id: '1',
  month: '2024-01',
  feeType: 'pmpm',
  amount: 450,
  enrollment: 1200,
  calculatedTotal: 540000,
  effectiveDate: '2024-01-01',
  description: 'Standard PMPM fee'
}

// Converts to V2 Structure
{
  id: 'fee-migrated-1',
  name: 'Migrated: Standard PMPM fee',
  category: 'administrative',
  rateBasis: 'pmpm',
  baseAmount: 450,
  tieringEnabled: false,
  effectiveStartDate: '2024-01-01',
  status: 'active',
  version: 1,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

### Manual Migration

If you need to migrate data now:

1. **Export V1 fees** to CSV (via browser console):
   ```javascript
   const v1Fees = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('healthcare-dashboard-data')).feeStructures;
   console.log(JSON.stringify(v1Fees, null, 2));
   ```

2. **Create V2 fees manually** via UI

3. **Verify calculations match**

## 🐛 Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: "My old fees are missing"

**Cause**: V1 and V2 use separate storage

**Solution**:
- Toggle to V1 to see old fees
- Use migration tool (when available)
- Or manually recreate in V2

---

### Issue 2: "Calculations don't match V1"

**Possible causes**:
- Different enrollment source selected
- V1 had manual overrides
- V2 using actual uploaded data vs estimates

**Solution**:
- Compare enrollment values
- Check Settings → Enrollment Source
- Verify uploaded CSV matches V1 data

---

### Issue 3: "I can't find the edit button"

**V1**: Direct grid editing
**V2**: Click Edit icon on fee card (left panel)

**Solution**: Look in left panel, not grid center

---

### Issue 4: "Where did my fee types go?"

**V1 types**:
- PMPM → Still exists in V2
- PEPM → Still exists in V2
- Flat → Still exists in V2
- Tiered → Now "PMPM with Tiering Enabled"
- Annual → Use "Manual" and divide by 12
- Manual → Still exists in V2

**Solution**: Map old types to new equivalents
